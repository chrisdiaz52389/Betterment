# Betterment
---------------
## Overview and Origin

Betterment was launched in 2010 by founder, Jon Stein. Financial advising, since the late 60s, has always been the staple
behind investing for one's future. A broker/financial advisor would call and network with clients, establish a book of business,
manage that book, grow and scale, rinse and repeat. It wasn't until the crash of 2008, that human error, became a critical component to
poor investment decisions. Jon, at the time, was studying at Columbia business school and had the idea of starting an investment
consulting business in probably one of the worst times in history. 

Jon was a contrarian thinker at heart, a man who saw people moving
in one direction and looked the other way. Fintech was a blip in the world of finance, but the potential, as we all know, is infinite.
Jon and several formidable collegues brought the idea of Betterment, which had already launched, to TechCrunch Disrupt.
TechCrunch Disrupt was a convention in NYC where tech startups can come and pitch their ideas for funding. It worked! 400 brave investors
put millions of dollars to scale and the vamp up this new idea of investing, Betterment.

## Business Activities

The purpose of Betterment is to remove the human element out of investment decision making by using a series of algorithms and
exchange-traded funds to help manage the individual investor. Investing, by nature, can be a roller coaster of emotions on both ends, 
meaning for the client and the advisor. Clients are quick to act when the market is down and when the market is up, which can lead to poor decisions. Betterment was established to completely remove that element by focusing on your risk tolerance and time horizon to create a sound comprehensive portfolio that buys and sells investments when certain indicators are met. Impulse and human error were completed eradicated.

The company's intended customer are those with little to no knowledge of investing and just want to sit and forget about their
portfolio. The market size of this type of customer is immense. There are plenty of individuals with no knowledge of proper investing, 
and even people with knowledge who realistically do not have the time to sit and read countless articles or interpret public company data.Betterment offers a painless, contactless solution to comprehensive wealth management. Their biggest advantage is cost, no advisor, 
means no wrap fee, which can typically range from 1% to 2% a year of your entire portfolio. Compounded overtime can result to hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

The site uses an incredible amount of code and softwares in order to keep pace with the ever changing environment of the market.Apache, Tomcat servers, and Java are at the root of the site. The technology behind the investment-making decisions involve a myriad of algorithmand portfolio allocation softwares that are strongheld by modern portfolio theory.

## Landscape

Betterment is in the wealth management within the finance industry. Over the last 5-10 years, algorithm based investments have become a pivotal source for not only robo-advisors, but traditional advising alike. For robo-advising, it is the foundation of the business, however for traditional advisors, it is a time saver that allows more time to find new clients instead of managing portfolios. 

Fees are in the Top 5 questions any prospect would ask prior to trusting you with their money. Financial wealth firms are constantly innovating to reduce the cost and maintain their competitiveness within the market. Betterment and other robo-advisors were the immediate disruptor to the infamous "fee question". Other robo-advising companies include but are not limited to Wealthfront, Personal Capital, Blooom, and Acorns.

## Results

Betterment, like any of investment firm, is measured by AUM "Assets under management". Currently, Betterment (within their domain) sits at the top of the list with an AUM of $21 Billion. Other core metrics include fees and features. Bettement charges 0.25% annually for their portfolios. As stated earlier, a large reduction, from the typical 1%-2% for traditional advising. When it comes to features, investors look for options and account types. Not only does Betterment offer standard taxable accounts, but also includes IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401ks, and trust accounts. Betterment also sits at top of the list when it comes to these metrics.

## Recommendations

After learning a great deal of the company, I would like to see Betterment offer portfolios in the alternative space. This can be
investments such as real estate, private equity, and crypto-currency. An algorithm to buy and sell stocks are just the tip of the iceberg,
there is no reason why the same code can be used to manage a portfolio of the previously names investment types. With the amount of new
alt-coins being introduced to the world, it is hard to keep track of which coin will offer the largest upside. Why not create
an algorithm to solve just that. A custom portfolio of alt-coins that are constantly trading with you having to use any brainpower to do so.
This new feature will most likely need blockchain technology along with the already existing algorithms to work.
The introduction to a robo-crpyto advisor has incredible potential.
